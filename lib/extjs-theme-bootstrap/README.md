##Project Goals

The goal of this project is to provide a simple uncluttered theme for ExtJS 4 while retaining a lot of the core [Bootstrap][1] classes that help to make good looking markup in record time!

It also includes the awesome icon set from [Glyphicons][2] to use throughout your application. 

##How to integrate with your ExtJS 4 project

Integrating this theme with your project is easy just do the following. 

 - Copy the contents of this download into your `public/resources` folder.
 - Modify your index page to include the bootstrap.css file 
 
	`<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="resources/css/bootstrap/bootstrap.css" />`
	
Now your ExtJS application should be using the new Bootstrap theme.

Look at the example apps shipped with this project on how to integrate the theme.

Please raise any [issues](https://www.github.com/NewbridgeGreen/extjs-theme-bootstrap/issues) if you have problems with integration
